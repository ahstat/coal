# Coal: Composition of Real Linear Functions

Begin with an example. Let *f: x ↦ x+1* and *g: x ↦ 2x*.
Let a word formed with *f* and *g* letters, for example *w="gfg"*.
By applying composition rules on *w*, we obtain for all *x*: 
*w(x)=gfg(x)=gf(2x)=g(2x+1)=4x+2*.
Slope is *4*, intercept is *2* and fixed point is *x=-2/3*.

This code automatizes composition of such linear functions.
When *f: x ↦ ax+b,* coefficients *a* and *b* can be formal letters, rational values or real values.
For rational values, gmp package is used to keep exact results.

## Motivating examples

### A functional way to count positive integers using two symbols
Let *f: x ↦ x+1* and *g: x ↦ 10x*.
Any positive integer *n* can be written as *w(1)* for some word *w* (unicity is not guaranteed).
For example: *3402 = ffggffffgff(1)*,

If we take instead *g: x ↦ 2x*,
we get something related to the binary representation of integers.

### Functions involved in Collatz conjecture
Let *f: x ↦ (1/3)x-1/3* and *g: x ↦ 2x*.
The [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) considers composition of those linear functions 
(here when beginning with *1* and going up on the tree).

Important note: This repository does not provide any advance in that conjecture.
Before wasting time with it, make sure you can understand its underlying complexity, for example by reading carefully [this post](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2011/08/25/the-collatz-conjecture-littlewood-offord-theory-and-powers-of-2-and-3).

## Documentation of functions

Each function is self-documented and contains unit tests.

### 1_linear_function.R
Code to define the `Linear function` class. A linear function contains the formal slope and intercept (as strings), and the related numeric slopes of intercepts (as a vector gmp numbers, since we can consider a whole range of slopes and intercepts together). We can do composition of linear functions with the `%o%` operator.

- `Linear function` (class): define a linear function with slopes and intercepts
- `initialize` (method)
- `f_base` (value): the function *f* for testing code.
- `g_base` (value): the function *g* for testing code.
- `id_n` (function)
- `is_defined_as_id` (function)
- `get_inverse` (function): Inverse function of a linear function
- `F_base` (value): inverse function *F* for testing code.
- `G_base` (value): inverse function *G* for testing code.
- `printf` (method)
- `split_coeff` (function)
- `poly_expansion` (function)
- `compo_formal` (function)
- `compo_numeric` (function)
- `compo` (method)
- `%o%` (function): composition of two linear functions
- `word2num` (function): convert word to **R**^{#word}, e.g. *fffgg* to *(2, 2, 1, 1, 1)*
- `linfun_init` (function): given *f* and *g* linear functions, get the linear function related to a specific word (not useful because we can use word tree class directly with some initialization)

### 2_evaluate_x.R
Evaluate a word of linear functions in some vector of values *x*. This is linked with the linear function class, and will be probably used only through the word tree class.

- `outer` (function)
- `rep_mat` (function)
- `compute_matrix_values` (function)
- `push_matrix_values` (function)
- `matrix_values_numeric` (function)
- `get_pos` (function)
- `to_integer_mat` (function)
- `is_NA_mat` (function)

### 3_word_tree.R
Define word tree class. An object of this class contains all information to perform compositions. Its main element is a dataframe with results on each (discrete) word.

- `Word tree` (class): define a word tree dataframe from voc, words_init, linfunc, x_init and x_integer_only
- `df_to_integer_df` (function)
- `initialize` (method)
- `add_letters` (function)
- `add_linfunc` (function)
- `add_values` (function)
- `push` (method): pushing one more letter
- `pushn` (method): pushing n more letters
- `signature_func` (function)
- `add_signature` (method): add the *(m, n)* of words as dataframe columns
- `add_coeffs` (method): add slope, intercept, fixed points as dataframe columns

### 4_word2coordinates.R
Convert words to vector of coordinates, i.e. not a single number but a vector. This is not directly related with the linear composition problem, but can be used after for trajectories.

- `voc_unique_func` (function)
- `voc_lower_func` (function)
- `voc_upper_func` (function)
- `voc2steps` (function)
- `walk_word` (function): define the path related to a word. This is useful to get trajectories of a word on the plane as a North-East path, this is done after.
- `coord_representation` (function)
- `coord_representation_n` (function)
- `compute_coord` (method): get a coordinate in a high dimension, this direction does not seems very good, because it is hard to work in this space, and no relation with the coefficients.

### 5_word2index.R
Convert words to index (as a natural number). This is not directly related with the linear composition problem, but can be useful to get an order on all the words.

- `word2index` (function): get a 'common' index of the words
- `add_common_index` (method): add this 'common' index to the dataframe of a word tree

### 9_continuous.R
Allow evaluation of continuous words. For example, how to go continuously from *fg* to *gfg*? A method is proposed for 2-letters compositions by representing each word as a probability distribution. The code is self-documented before `iota_vector`. After that, please contact me if you need to understand it in details. Main functions are `alpha`, `beta`, `x0` and `move`.

Example 1: We define a continuous road from *fg* to *gfg*: *g<sup>0</sup>fg*, *g<sup>0.1</sup>fg*, *g<sup>0.2</sup>fg* ..., *g<sup>0.9</sup>fg*, *gfg*. Each element *g<sup>x</sup>fg* is a linear function where slope is given by `alpha`; intercept by `beta`; fixed point by `x0`. 

Example 2: Given *gfg*, we can make a continuous road from *gfg* to *gfg* using `move` function: *gfg*, *g<sup>0.9</sup>fg<sup>1.1</sup>*, *g<sup>0.8</sup>fg<sup>1.2</sup>*, ..., *g<sup>0.1</sup>fg<sup>1.9</sup>*, *fgg*, *f<sup>0.9</sup>ggf<sup>0.1</sup>*, *f<sup>0.8</sup>ggf<sup>0.2</sup>*, ..., *f<sup>0.1</sup>ggf<sup>0.9</sup>*, *ggf*, *g<sup>0.9</sup>gfg<sup>0.1</sup>*, *g<sup>0.8</sup>gfg<sup>0.2</sup>*, ..., *g<sup>0.1</sup>gfg<sup>0.9</sup>*, *gfg*.
